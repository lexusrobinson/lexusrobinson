I'm an aspiring front-end developer based in Central Florida. Recently, I completed a coding bootcamp where I gained skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Iâ€™m excited to bring my creativity and attention to detail to my first project, and I'm eager to collaborate with others to build websites that are both functional and visually appealing. As I continue to grow in my coding journey, I'm looking for an opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting, learn from experienced developers, and contribute to building exceptional digital experiences.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT
